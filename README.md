# angular-dynamic-components demo
This project demonstrates building dynamic components with Angular (15.x.x). 
An alternative (simpler) approach with `CSS` is also shown.

- the use of `EmbeddedViewRef`, `ViewContainerRef` / `ViewRef`, `TemplateRef` demonstrated
- the goal also achieved with `CSS` means (less flexible, but in many cases feasible and much simpler approach)

# description
- when the user clicks `[SWITCH PLACES]` the two cards switch places without re-instantiation (as can be seen in the console)
